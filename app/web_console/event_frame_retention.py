"""Incremental retention using the existing (conversation, operation, revision) index.

SQLite's secondary index also contains rowid. Do *not* paginate with a four-
column tuple including id: SQLite only seeks the three explicit index columns
and rescans equal revisions. Instead finish the current revision by rowid seek,
then seek strictly past its three-column prefix. Every SELECT has a small LIMIT
before any eligibility filtering; an arbitrarily long protected run is cheap.

Rows are grouped by operation, but revision need not be monotone with id. Carry
only the largest id seen for the current operation between pages. That row is
never a delete candidate until a strictly larger id supplies a retention witness.
Thus a completed sweep removes exactly the eligible superseded rows, without a
GROUP BY, an operation-wide MAX scan, or an unbounded in-memory set of operations.
